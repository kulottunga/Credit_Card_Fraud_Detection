Credit Card Fraud Detection

📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection in financial systems is critical for maintaining user trust and reducing financial losses. By analyzing transaction patterns, the project aims to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with precision.

🎯 Objectives

Identify fraudulent transactions accurately using machine learning models.

Minimize false positives to ensure legitimate transactions are not flagged incorrectly.

Understand key features that influence fraudulent behavior.

🔍 Approach

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, and address class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze transaction data to uncover patterns and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features to enhance model performance.

Modeling: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate them based on precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.

Insights and Recommendations: Interpret the model’s results to provide actionable insights.
